### Core Development Manager

jan. 2012 - today · 11 years

Dassault Systèmes gather a lot of data for their clients and develop several application on top of it. At Exalead, we develop a search engine to access this data faster. We have different data structures to cover different use cases like full text search (such as [lucene](https://lucene.apache.org/), graph traversal but also analytics.

Some of my role as a Java lead developper focused on performance:
- Implementation of some key query feature like JOIN or GROUP BY
- Work on query parallelism to speed up the engine using multiple CPU cores
- Set up benches to identify slow code or bad memory footprint and fix it or mentor someone to do it
- Analyse production problem (crash, performance issue...) using several tools (perf, vtune, yourkit, JFR)

The deployment of our stack is on the cloud. I'm in charge of the architecture of the service:
- I design and implement the VM definition and made the evolution required to scale horizontally at first. We are able to dynamically add or remove nodes in a cluster.
- I'm working on the global HA of the stack.
- Reworked the monitoring of our service by installing a new stack based on prometheus/grafana
