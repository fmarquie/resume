### Core Development Manager

jan. 2012 - today · 10 years 11 months

Dassault Systèmes gather a lot of data for their clients and develop several application on top of it. At Exalead, we develop a search engine to access data faster. I design and implement parts of this software. Some of my role:
- Implementation of some query nodes like JOIN or GROUP BY
- Worked on multi-pipeline parallelisms to speed up queries using multiple CPU cores.
- Our engine requires top performance to answer queries. I develop benches to identify slow code and fix it.

The first deployment of our stack is on the cloud. I design and implement the VM definition and made the evolution required to scale horizontally at first. Now I'm working on the global HA of the stack.
